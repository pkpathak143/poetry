this materialistic world, once in our lives. At that time of undetermined condition and confusion, the poems
will make our heart clear of all the debris and unwanted feelings and make our heart pure with the awakened 
soul. We have to make it clear that we want peace and love in this wonderful life over all other things of 
materialism. Here are those poems which come under this kind of nature to make yourself proud of having been 
born MAN / WOMAN in this beautiful world. We have collected these poems with deligence and long-waiting. The

<b>Poetry</b>
</font>

	<font size="+2" color="#FFF3F4">
Poetry (derived from the Greek poiesis, "making") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and often rhythmic
qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in
place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.

Poetry has a long history - dating back to prehistoric times with hunting poetry in Africa, and to panegyric and
elegiac court poetry of the empires of the Nile, Niger, and Volta River valleys. Some of the earliest written poetry
in Africa occurs among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th century BCE. The earliest surviving Western Asian
epic poetry, the Epic of Gilgamesh, was written in Sumerian.

Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing; or from a need to retell
oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, the Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric,
drama, song, and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form, and rhyme, and 
emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative prosaic writing.

Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretations of words, or to evoke emotive responses. 
Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia, and rhythm may convey musical or incantatory effects. The use
of ambiguity, symbolism, irony, and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple 
interpretations. Similarly, figures of speech such as metaphor, simile, and metonymy establish a resonance between 
otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of 
resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.

Some poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in
which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz, or Rumi may think of
it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter. There are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, 
that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, 
testing the principle of euphony itself or altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm. In an increasingly[citation
needed] globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles, and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.


A Western cultural tradition (which extends at least from Homer to Rilke) associates the production of poetry 
with inspiration - often by a Muse (either classical or contemporary).

<b>Western Traditions</b>
</font>

<font size="+2" color="#FFF3F4">
Classical thinkers in the West employed classification as a way to define and assess the quality of poetry. Notably,
the existing fragments of Aristotle's Poetics describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and
develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the perceived underlying purposes of
the genre. Later aestheticians identified three major genres: epic poetry, lyric poetry, and dramatic poetry, 
treating comedy and tragedy as subgenres of dramatic poetry.

Aristotle's work was influential throughout the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, as well as in Europe
during the Renaissance. Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from, and defined it in opposition
to prose, which they generally understood as writing with a proclivity to logical explication and a linear narrative
structure.

This does not imply that poetry is illogical or lacks narration, but rather that poetry is an attempt to render the
beautiful or sublime without the burden of engaging the logical or narrative thought-process. English Romantic poet
John Keats termed this escape from logic "Negative capability". This "romantic" approach views form as a key element
of successful poetry because form is abstract and distinct from the underlying notional logic. This approach remained
influential into the 20th century.

During this period,[when?] there was also substantially more interaction among the various poetic traditions, in part 
due to the spread of European colonialism and the attendant rise in global trade. In addition to a boom in 
translation, during the Romantic period numerous ancient works were rediscovered.

<b>20th-Century and 21st-Century Disputes</b>
</font>
<br>
<font size="+2" color="#FFF3F4">
Some 20th-century literary theorists rely less on the ostensible opposition of prose and poetry, instead focusing on
the poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet creates. The underlying concept of
the poet as creator is not uncommon, and some modernist poets essentially do not distinguish between the creation of 
a poem with words, and creative acts in other media. Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry
as misguided.

The rejection of traditional forms and structures for poetry that began in the first half of the 20th century
coincided with a questioning of the purpose and meaning of traditional definitions of poetry and of distinctions
between poetry and prose, particularly given examples of poetic prose and prosaic poetry. Numerous modernist poets 
have written in non-traditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their 
writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-metrical means. 
While there was a substantial formalist reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this 
reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms 
and structures.

Recently,[when?] postmodernism has come to regard more completely prose and poetry as distinct entities, and also 
different genres of poetry as having meaning only as cultural artifacts. Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's 
emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to emphasize the role of the reader of a text (hermeneutics), and to 
highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read. Today, throughout the world, poetry often 
incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the past, further confounding attempts at 
definition and classification that once made sense within a tradition such as the Western canon.

The early 21st-century poetic tradition appears to continue to strongly orient itself to earlier precursor poetic 
traditions such as those initiated by Whitman, Emerson, and Wordsworth. The literary critic Geoffrey Hartman (1929-
2016) used the phrase "the anxiety of demand" to describe the contemporary response to older poetic traditions as 
"being fearful that the fact no longer has a form", building on a trope introduced by Emerson. Emerson had 
maintained that in the debate concerning poetic structure where either "form" or "fact" could predominate, that one
need simply "Ask the fact for the form." This has been challenged at various levels by other literary scholars such 
as Bloom (1930-2019), who has stated: "The generation of poets who stand together now, mature and ready to write the
major American verse of the twenty-first century, may yet be seen as what Stevens called 'a great shadow's last 
embellishment,' the shadow being Emerson's."
